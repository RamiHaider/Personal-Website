                    <h3> Introduction</h3>
                    <p> This blog shows in python programming language the effectiveness of hashing method versus double nested loops by solving the LeetCode twosum exercise, and achieving a 99% percentile time complexity score. This is a deep-dive that goes into theory, and assumes you know very little to know programming languages and concepts. Thus, it's not a specialized deep-dive, but a horizontal one, meant for particularly curious and inquisitive individuals interested in the workings of computer science concepts.</p>

                    <h3>TwoSum Problem</h3>
                    <p>Given a list of integers and a target sum, find the indices of the two numbers in the list that add up to the target.</p>

                    <div class="code-block">
                        Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
                        Output: [0,1]
                        Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

                    <h4>Nested Loop or 'Brute Force' Approach</h4>
                    <p>The nested loop approach involves checking every possible pair of numbers in the list using double for-loops, one nested within the other.</p>
                    
                    <div class="code-block">
                        Given an input: [a,b,c,d,e]
                        
                        We need to check each possible pair once:
                        
                        i.e.,
                        
                        [a,b], [a,c], [a,d], [a,e]
                        [b,c], [b,d], [b,e]
                        [c,d], [c,e]
                        [d,e]
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>While straightforward, this method can be inefficient for large lists.</p>

                    <h4>Time Complexity Analysis</h4>
                    <p>For a list of size n, the nested loop approach performs approximately (n * (n-1) / 2) * 4 operations. For a list of 1000 elements, this results in about 1,998,000 operations.</p>

                    <h3>Hash Table Approach</h3>
                    <p>The hash table approach uses a dictionary to store complement values, allowing for much faster lookups.</p>

                    <h4>Time Complexity Analysis</h4>
                    <p>For a list of size n, the hash table approach performs approximately n * 3 operations. For a list of 1000 elements, this results in only about 3,000 operations.</p>

                    <h3>Memory Considerations</h3>
                    <p>While hash tables offer faster lookups, they do use more memory compared to the nested loop approach. This trade-off between speed and memory usage is a common theme in algorithm design.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>The hash table approach demonstrates why it's considered O(n) time complexity, while the nested loop is O(n^2). This significant difference in efficiency becomes even more pronounced as the size of the input grows.</p>
